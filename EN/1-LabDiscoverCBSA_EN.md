## 4. Lab Context
[↩️](#-table-of-contents)
### The Application: CICS Banking Sample Application (CBSA)

You will work on a real banking application that simulates bank teller operations:

**Technical characteristics:**
- **Platform:** IBM z/OS with CICS Transaction Server V5.4+
- **Language:** IBM Enterprise COBOL for z/OS
- **Database:** IBM Db2 V12+
- **Interface:** 3270 terminals with BMS (Basic Mapping Support)
- **Architecture:** Transaction processing with online and batch programs

**Business functionalities:**
- Customer creation and management
- Bank account creation and management
- Account inquiry
- Transfers between accounts
- Account debit/credit
- External credit agency simulation

**Complexity:**
- 29 COBOL programs
- 37 copybooks
- 9 BMS screens
- 4 Db2 tables
- Multi-tier architecture (presentation, business logic, data)

### Initial Situation

You have just joined the maintenance team for this application. You have the source code but:

- ❌ No up-to-date technical documentation
- ❌ No program inventory
- ❌ Undocumented architecture
- ❌ Business rules not formalized
- ❌ Dependencies between programs unknown
- ❌ Impact of modifications difficult to assess

**Your mission:** Use Bob Premium for Z to analyze and document this application in a few hours instead of several weeks.

### Preliminary Remarks


- <span style="color: red;">Bob relies on AI agentics, which by definition is not deterministic. For some exercises, you may therefore notice slight differences between your result and the one described in this lab. And sometimes, you will have to add additional instructions to Bob to get the expected result. This is, in general, the approach to have with Bob: it always gets to the result, but sometimes you have to take a different path to get there.</span>
- **Counts made by AI can be inaccurate. Therefore, calculations should be done by engineering rather than by AI.**
- IBM Bob Premium for Z relies on existing metadata or metadata it builds in a local database. In the discussion with Bob, it may ask whether to use a centralized metadata repository (e.g., "Do you want to use the Z Understand service for a complete dependency analysis, or analyze only the local workspace?"). **In the context of this lab, we do not use the Z Understand service.**
- In the various exercises to follow, Bob will be able to propose different options in response to a prompt. It is important to choose the right option to obtain the desired result. In any case, you can always go back and test another option.

## Exercise 0: Define Naming and Organization Rules
[↩️](#-table-of-contents)

### 🎯 Objective

Before starting your project analysis, establish the rules and conventions to apply.
For example, clear conventions for organizing and naming resources generated by Bob to maintain a structured and consistent workspace.
And specify that documentation will be written in English.


### ✍️ Your Prompt

Write your own prompt to ask Bob to define naming and organization conventions for generated resources.

**Expected in your prompt:**
- specify target directories ([`docs/`](docs) for documentation, [`tools/`](tools) for tools)
- impose a structured naming convention
- provide concrete examples of expected format
- explicitly request the update of [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)

### ✅ Recommended Prompt

```text
Create the following Bob rules: - Documents must be stored in the docs/ directory, tools in tools/, - Document names must follow these conventions:
-- Prefix: program name (e.g., BNKMENU) if the document concerns a specific program, or CBSA for the application, or GLOBAL for cross-cutting documents
-- Document type: analysis, archi, docu, inv, plan, spec
-- Format: [PREFIX]-[TYPE]-[description].md
```

### 🔀 Prompt Variants

```text
Define a standard naming convention for all documents and tools generated in this workspace, then save it in AGENTS.md.
```

```text
Add rules in AGENTS.md for organizing documentation and scripts, with a consistent naming format and examples.
```

### ✅ Expected Result

Bob updates the **`AGENTS.md`** file with a dedicated section for conventions and may create a specific document to detail naming conventions:

```markdown

## File Organization

### Directory Structure

- **`docs/`**: All project documents (analyses, architectures, specifications, etc.)
- **`tools/`**: Scripts and utility tools for the project
- **`base/`**: CICS banking application source code
  - `cobol_src/`: COBOL programs
  - `cobol_copy/`: COBOL copybooks
  - `bms_src/`: BMS screen definitions

## Document Naming Conventions
...

```

#### Note:
Bob may create the rules in the .bob/rules.md file rather than in AGENTS.md. It will take the rules into account the same way, whether in one file or the other

### ✍️ Your Prompt to complete the rules.

Write your own prompt to ask Bob to add a global rule for generating documentation in English.

**Expected in your prompt:**
- explicitly request the addition of a Bob rule
- specify that this rule concerns the output language
- request persistence of this rule in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)

### ✅ Recommended Prompt

```text
Add a Bob rule: generate documentation in English and respond in English.
```

### 🔀 Prompt Variants

```text
Add a rule in AGENTS.md indicating that all generated documentation must be written in English.
```

```text
Define a Bob convention imposing English as the default language for documentation deliverables.
```


### ✅ Expected Result

Bob updates the **`AGENTS.md`** file with a new rule.
```markdown
## Documentation Language

**IMPORTANT RULE**: All documentation must be written in English.

- Documents in `docs/` must be in English
- Comments in tools (`tools/`) must be in English
- README and documentation files must be in English
- Only file names, variables, and source code can remain in their original language
```

### 🎓 What You Learn

- **Agents.md** (or **.bob/rules.md**) provides the rules that will be applied to the workspace.

- **Structured organization:** A well-organized workspace facilitates navigation and maintenance
- **Clear conventions:** Consistent naming rules allow quick document retrieval
- **Scalability:** The structure supports project growth without disorganization
- **Collaboration:** The entire team follows the same conventions

### 💡 Best Practices

1. **Always respect conventions**: Even for temporary documents
2. **Use descriptive names**: The name should clearly indicate the content
3. **Organize by type**: Group similar documents in the same directories
4. **Document exceptions**: If you must deviate from rules, document why in AGENTS.md

### ⚠️ Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Creating documents at the project root
- ❌ Using generic names like `doc1.md`, `analysis.md`
- ❌ Mixing multiple content types in one document
- ❌ Forgetting the prefix (program or CBSA/GLOBAL)
- **Critical patterns:** Bob identifies mandatory compilation directives and error patterns

### 💡 Bob Premium for Z Added Value

| Without Bob | With Bob Premium for Z |
|----------|------------------------|
| 2-3 days of manual exploration | 2-3 minutes of automatic analysis |
| Incomplete documentation | Exhaustive and structured documentation |
| Risk of missing critical patterns | All patterns automatically identified |
| No standardization | Conventions established from the start |

- CONTROL counters: Key for control records (format: "987654-ACCOUNT" or "987654-CUSTOMER")
- Cleanup: Criterion to delete data by branch

***6. Utility Program (GETSCODE)***

Distribution: Returns SORTCODE to calling programs via COMMAREA

***Key Structures***

***Composite Keys Using SORTCODE***

1- ACCOUNT (DB2): SORTCODE (6) + ACCOUNT_NUMBER (8) = 14 characters

2- CUSTOMER (VSAM): SORTCODE (6) + CUSTOMER_NUMBER (10) = 16 characters

3- CONTROL (DB2): "SORTCODE-TYPE" (e.g., "987654-ACCOUNT")


***Architectural Importance***
- Data isolation: Allows separating data by branch
- Scalability: Facilitates data distribution in a multi-branch environment
- Security: Limits access to data from a specific branch
- Audit: Complete traceability of operations by branch

## Exercise 5b: Business Rules Analysis and Inline Code Generation
[↩️](#-table-of-contents)

### 🎯 Objective

Query Bob about business rules coded in a module, then ask him to create a new one from the editor

### 🔧 Bob Mode to Use

**Mode: 🧰 Z Code**

Z Code mode excels at pattern analysis and extracting business rules embedded in COBOL code.

### 📝 Context

BNK1CAC is the account creation program. It validates input data with a list of rules.

### ✍️ Your Prompt

```text
Extract and save in an md file, the business rules of BNK1CAC
```
**Expected in your prompt:**
- target the prompt on the target module
- request implicit business rules

### ✅ Expected Result

Creation of the BNK1CAC-business-rules.md file.

It should contain Input Validation Rules
- Customer Number Validation
- Account Type Validation
- Interest Rate Validation
...

There are three checks on the customer number (length, no underscores, numeric). We will add a new one: the customer number must start with 99.

Comment: the file should also contain other sections than "Input Validation Rules". They can be considered more technical than business rules and be removed).

### ✅ Prompt to Create the New Rule:

Open BNK1CAC.cbl in the editor. Place your cursor at the beginning of line 458 (which should be just after the validation that the customer number is numeric) and type in the editor

```text
add a test to verify that a customer number must start with 99
```

A light bulb appears at the beginning of the sentence. Click on it and select "Add to IBM Bob"

### ✅ Expected Result 

In the IBM Bob prompt area appears:
```text
base\cobol_src\BNK1CAC.cbl:458-458
'''
add a test to verify that a customer number must start with 99
'''
```

Send the prompt to IBM Bob

### ✅ Expected Result 
1 - BNK1CAC is updated with a new rule starting at line 459:
```text
           IF CUSTNOI(1:2) NOT = '99'
              MOVE SPACES TO MESSAGEO
              STRING 'Customer number must start with 99'
                    DELIMITED BY SIZE,
                     ' ' DELIMITED BY SIZE
                 INTO MESSAGEO
              MOVE 'N' TO VALID-DATA-SW
              MOVE -1 TO CUSTNOL
              GO TO ED999
           END-IF.
```

2 - BNK1CAC-business-rules.md is updated with the new rule and its associated error message.

How is the SORTCODE variable used in the application?
```

### ✅ Expected Result

Analysis of SORTCODE variable usage in the CBSA application.

***Definition***
SORTCODE is a constant defined in the SORTCODE.cpy copybook with value 987654 (6 digits).

***Role in Application***
SORTCODE identifies the bank branch where accounts and customers are managed. It's a branch identifier used throughout the banking system.

***Usage by Program***

***1. Creation Programs (CREACC, CRECUST)***
- Key generation: Used to generate account/customer numbers via CICS named counters
- DB2/VSAM storage: Stored in ACCOUNT tables (DB2) and CUSTOMER files (VSAM)
- Audit: Included in PROCTRAN records for traceability

***2. Inquiry Programs (INQACC, INQACCCU, INQCUST)***
- SQL search criterion: Used in WHERE clauses to filter accounts by branch
```sql
WHERE ACCOUNT_SORTCODE = :HV-ACCOUNT-SORTCODE
```

- VSAM key: Part of composite key to access CUSTOMER records

***3. Update Programs (UPDACC, UPDCUST, DBCRFUN, XFRFUN)***
- Identification: Identifies the account's branch to modify
- Validation: Verifies operations are performed on correct branch
- Transactions: Recorded in PROCTRAN for each successful operation

***4. Deletion Programs (DELACC, DELCUS)***
- Deletion criterion: Used to precisely target records to delete
- Audit: Traced in PROCTRAN before deletion

***5. Batch Program (BANKDATA)***
- Initialization: Used to create test data with SORTCODE 987654
- CONTROL counters: Key for control records (format: "987654-ACCOUNT" or "987654-CUSTOMER")
- Cleanup: Criterion to delete data by branch

***6. Utility Program (GETSCODE)***

Distribution: Returns SORTCODE to calling programs via COMMAREA

***Key Structures***

***Composite Keys Using SORTCODE***

1- ACCOUNT (DB2): SORTCODE (6) + ACCOUNT_NUMBER (8) = 14 characters

2- CUSTOMER (VSAM): SORTCODE (6) + CUSTOMER_NUMBER (10) = 16 characters

3- CONTROL (DB2): "SORTCODE-TYPE" (ex: "987654-ACCOUNT")


***Architectural Importance***
- Data isolation: Allows separating data by branch
- Scalability: Facilitates data distribution in multi-branch environment
- Security: Limits access to specific branch data
- Audit: Complete traceability of operations by branch

***Current Value***

***987654*** - Branch code used for CBSA application test/demonstration environment.

## Exercise 9: Automation with Bobshell Premium Z
[↩️](#-table-of-contents)

### 🎯 Objective

Create a Bobshell (automated script) to automatically generate documentation for all application programs.

### 🔧 Bob Mode to Use

**Mode: 💻 Code**

Code mode allows creating automation scripts (Bobshells) that execute repetitive tasks.

### 📝 Context

You have 28 COBOL programs in the CBSA application. Manually documenting each program would take several weeks. A Bobshell can automate this task and generate standardized documentation for all programs in minutes.

### 💬 Bob Prompt

```
Create a Bobshell that automatically generates technical documentation for each COBOL program in base/cobol_src/. For each program, the documentation must include:
- Program description
- Business objective
- Copybooks used
- Files accessed
- Programs called
- Code structure (sections and paragraphs)
- Main variables
- Identified business rules

Store each documentation in docs/ with naming format: [PROGRAM]-docu-technique.md
```

### ✅ Expected Result

Bob creates **`tools/generate-program-docs.bobshell`**:

```yaml

    action: "generate_index"
    params:
      title: "CBSA Documentation Index"
      output: "${output_dir}/CBSA-inv-documentation.md"
      items: "${program_list}"

# Final report
