## 4. Lab Context
[↩️](#-table-of-contents)
### The Application: CICS Banking Sample Application (CBSA)

You will work on a real banking application that simulates bank teller operations:

**Technical characteristics:**
- **Platform:** IBM z/OS with CICS Transaction Server V5.4+
- **Language:** IBM Enterprise COBOL for z/OS
- **Database:** IBM Db2 V12+
- **Interface:** 3270 terminals with BMS (Basic Mapping Support)
- **Architecture:** Transaction processing with online and batch programs

**Business functionalities:**
- Customer creation and management
- Bank account creation and management
- Account inquiry
- Transfers between accounts
- Account debit/credit
- External credit agency simulation

**Complexity:**
- 29 COBOL programs
- 37 copybooks
- 9 BMS screens
- 4 Db2 tables
- Multi-tier architecture (presentation, business logic, data)

### Initial Situation

You have just joined the maintenance team for this application. You have the source code but:

- ❌ No up-to-date technical documentation
- ❌ No program inventory
- ❌ Undocumented architecture
- ❌ Business rules not formalized
- ❌ Dependencies between programs unknown
- ❌ Impact of modifications difficult to assess

**Your mission:** Use IBM Bob Premium Package for Z to analyze and document this application in a few hours instead of several weeks.

### Preliminary Remarks


- <span style="color: red;">Bob relies on AI agentics, which by definition is not deterministic. For some exercises, you may therefore notice slight differences between your result and the one described in this lab. And sometimes, you will have to add additional instructions to Bob to get the expected result. This is, in general, the approach to have with Bob: it always gets to the result, but sometimes you have to take a different path to get there.</span>
- **Counts made by AI can be inaccurate. Therefore, calculations should be done by engineering rather than by AI.**
- IBM Bob Premium Package for Z relies on existing metadata or metadata it builds in a local database. In the discussion with Bob, it may ask whether to use a centralized metadata repository (e.g., "Do you want to use the Z Understand service for a complete dependency analysis, or analyze only the local workspace?"). **In the context of this lab, we do not use the Z Understand service.**
- In the various exercises to follow, Bob will be able to propose different options in response to a prompt. It is important to choose the right option to obtain the desired result. In any case, you can always go back and test another option.

## Exercise 0: Define Naming and Organization Rules
[↩️](#-table-of-contents)

### 🎯 Objective

Before starting your project analysis, establish the rules and conventions to apply.
For example, clear conventions for organizing and naming resources generated by Bob to maintain a structured and consistent workspace.


### ✍️ Your Prompt

Write your own prompt to ask Bob to define naming and organization conventions for generated resources.

**Expected in your prompt:**
- specify target directories ([`docs/`](docs) for documentation, [`tools/`](tools) for tools)
- impose a structured naming convention
- provide concrete examples of expected format
- explicitly request the update of [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)

### ✅ Recommended Prompt

```text
Create the following Bob rules: - Documents must be stored in the docs/ directory, tools in tools/, - Document names must follow these conventions:
-- Prefix: program name (e.g., BNKMENU) if the document concerns a specific program, or CBSA for the application, or GLOBAL for cross-cutting documents
-- Document type: analysis, archi, docu, inv, plan, spec
-- Format: [PREFIX]-[TYPE]-[description].md
```

### 🔀 Prompt Variants

```text
Define a standard naming convention for all documents and tools generated in this workspace, then save it in AGENTS.md.
```

```text
Add rules in AGENTS.md for organizing documentation and scripts, with a consistent naming format and examples.
```

### ✅ Expected Result

Bob updates the **`AGENTS.md`** file with a dedicated section for conventions and may create a specific document to detail naming conventions:



## File Organization

### Directory Structure

- **`docs/`**: All project documents (analyses, architectures, specifications, etc.)
- **`tools/`**: Scripts and utility tools for the project
- **`base/`**: CICS banking application source code
  - `cobol_src/`: COBOL programs
  - `cobol_copy/`: COBOL copybooks
  - `bms_src/`: BMS screen definitions

## Document Naming Conventions
...


### 🎓 What You Learn

- **Agents.md** (or **.bob/rules.md**) provides the rules that will be applied to the workspace.

- **Structured organization:** A well-organized workspace facilitates navigation and maintenance
- **Clear conventions:** Consistent naming rules allow quick document retrieval
- **Scalability:** The structure supports project growth without disorganization
- **Collaboration:** The entire team follows the same conventions

### 💡 Best Practices

1. **Always respect conventions**: Even for temporary documents
2. **Use descriptive names**: The name should clearly indicate the content
3. **Organize by type**: Group similar documents in the same directories
4. **Document exceptions**: If you must deviate from rules, document why in AGENTS.md

### ⚠️ Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Creating documents at the project root
- ❌ Using generic names like `doc1.md`, `analysis.md`
- ❌ Mixing multiple content types in one document
- ❌ Forgetting the prefix (program or CBSA/GLOBAL)
- **Critical patterns:** Bob identifies mandatory compilation directives and error patterns

### 💡 IBM Bob Premium Package for Z Added Value

- Identification: Identifies the account's branch to modify
- Validation: Verifies operations are performed on correct branch
- Transactions: Recorded in PROCTRAN for each successful operation

***4. Deletion Programs (DELACC, DELCUS)***
- Deletion criterion: Used to precisely target records to delete
- Audit: Traced in PROCTRAN before deletion

***5. Batch Program (BANKDATA)***
- Initialization: Used to create test data with SORTCODE 987654
- CONTROL counters: Key for control records (format: "987654-ACCOUNT" or "987654-CUSTOMER")
- Cleanup: Criterion to delete data by branch

***6. Utility Program (GETSCODE)***

Distribution: Returns SORTCODE to calling programs via COMMAREA

***Key Structures***

***Composite Keys Using SORTCODE***

1- ACCOUNT (DB2): SORTCODE (6) + ACCOUNT_NUMBER (8) = 14 characters

2- CUSTOMER (VSAM): SORTCODE (6) + CUSTOMER_NUMBER (10) = 16 characters

3- CONTROL (DB2): "SORTCODE-TYPE" (ex: "987654-ACCOUNT")


***Architectural Importance***
- Data isolation: Allows separating data by branch
- Scalability: Facilitates data distribution in multi-branch environment
- Security: Limits access to specific branch data
- Audit: Complete traceability of operations by branch

Query Bob about the business rules coded in a module, then ask it to create a new one from the editor

### 🔧 Bob Mode to Use

**Mode: 🧰 Z Code**

Z Code mode excels at pattern analysis and extracting business rules embedded in COBOL code.

### 📝 Context

BNK1CAC is the create account program. It verifies the input with a list of rules.

### ✍️ Your Prompt

Extract and save in a md file, the business rules from @cobol_src/BNK1CAC.cbl

**Expected in your prompt:**
- scope the promp to the target module
- request implicit business rules

### ✅ Expected Result

Creation of BNK1CAC-business-rules.md file.

It should contain Input Validation Rules
- Customer Number Validation
- Account Type Validation
- Interest Rate Validation
...

Thare are three verifications on the customer number (length, not underscore, numeric). We will add a new one: the customer number should start with 99.

Comment: the file should also contain other sections than "Input Validation Rules". They may be considered to be more technical rules than business rules and removed).

### ✅ Prompt to Create the new rule:

Open BNK1CAC.cbl in the editor. Place your cursor at the beginning of line 458 (which should be just after the validation that the customer number is numeric) and enter in the editor

```text
add a test to verify a customer number should start with 99
```

A bulb appears at the begining of the sentence. Click it and select "Add to IBM Bob"

### ✅ Expected Result 

In the prompt area of IBM Bob appears:
```text
base\cobol_src\BNK1CAC.cbl:458-458
'''

'''
```

Send the prompt to IBM Bob

### ✅ Expected Result 
1 - BNK1CAC is updated with a new rule startting at line 459:
```text
           IF CUSTNOI(1:2) NOT = '99'
              MOVE SPACES TO MESSAGEO
              STRING 'Customer number must start with 99'
                    DELIMITED BY SIZE,
                     ' ' DELIMITED BY SIZE
                 INTO MESSAGEO
              MOVE 'N' TO VALID-DATA-SW
              MOVE -1 TO CUSTNOL
              GO TO ED999
           END-IF.
```

## Exercise 8: Email Search Implementation
[↩️](#-table-of-contents)

### 🎯 Objective

Design and implement a new feature allowing customer identification by email address.

### 🔧 Bob Mode to Use

**Modes: 📐 Z Architect → 🧰 Z Code**

- 📐 Z Architect: To define and plan the complete solution for Z/OS

- 🧰 Z Code: To generate COBOL code for the new feature


### 📝 Context

The business wants to modernize the application by allowing customers to be identified by email rather than customer number. This evolution requires:
- Adding an email field to data structures
- Creating an alternate VSAM index for search
- Developing a new search program
- Modifying existing programs

You can first verify current search modes to ensure the new feature is consistent with existing functionality. The following prompt allows this verification:

```text
what criteria can be used to search for a customer in CBSA?
```
---

### Part A: Implementation Planning

#### 🔧 Mode: 📐 Z Architect

#### 💬 Bob Prompt

```
What is the plan to implement customer search by email?
```

#### ✅ Expected Result

Bob creates **`docs/CBSA-plan-email-search.md`**:
```
   ## 1. Executive Summary

   **Change Description**: Implementation of a new customer search feature by email address in the CBSA banking application. This feature will allow users to search for customers using partial email search (domain or address beginning).

   **Business Value**: Improves user experience by allowing flexible customer search by email, facilitating quick customer identification without requiring customer number or sort code. Particularly useful for customer support and service operations.

   **Key Risks**:
   1. Performance of LIKE queries on DB2 with large volumes
   2. Absence of email field in existing CUSTOMER VSAM structure
   3. Email data synchronization between systems

   **Workspace Notes**: All analyzed programs are available locally. Current CUSTOMER structure does not contain email field.
